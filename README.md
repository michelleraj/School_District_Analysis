# Overview of the School District Analysis

The purpose of the School District analysis was to use tools like python and pandas to retrieve key metrics of each school within each school districts. Created school district summary with metrics such school performance based on overall passing grade, school size and type of school. student budgets, and many more attributes by creating a data frame from the CSV file provided. 


# Results

By changing the scores of the Thomas High School the scores of the reading and math have been significantly changed, while observing the district summary only slight changes in the numbers after the decimal point are observed. At the same time, the School summary has changed significantly as the data for the school type has been changed

Replacing Thomas high school scores 9th graders have made Thomas high school be the second-best school relative to the other schools but relative to the overall analysis the percet=ntage of the scores have gone down

REplacing Thomas high school 9th graders have made an increase in the passing math and reading score to increase their score by the amount of almost 20 points

The scores by School spending remains almost the same, the score by School size also tends to remain the same but there has been some change while looking into the score by School type 

# Summary
